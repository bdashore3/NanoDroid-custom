### Fix OTA-Update issues

`-f`, `--fix-update`

fix issues with the navigation bar, status bar or lock screen after applying an OTA update; for a detailed description about this check [> XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/broken-navigation-bar-lock-screen-ota-update/)

### Airplane Mode settings

`-P`, `--airplane-mode`

This allows to change which radios are disabled by Airplane Mode **and additionally** it instructs Android that it does **not** allow re-activation of **those** radios until Airplane Mode is switched off

### Prevent audio focus stealing

`-F`, `--audio-focus` [app]

some apps stop audio playback of other apps, when you bring them in foreground (or activate them in multi window mode), with this you can prevent Android from allowing this; [app] is the application name in `com.organisation.application` format, for example `com.xda.labs`

### Prevent clipboard reading

`-B`, `--read-clipboard` [app]

many apps have the permission to read the clipboard for no reason, with this you can prevent Android from allowing this; [app] is the application name in `com.organisation.application` format, for example `com.xda.labs`

**Note:** don't do this in applications like Browsers or the-like, as you'll disable the whole copy-paste feature for those app(s) with this feature

### Read boot count

`-b`, `--boot-count`

show how often the device was booted; requires Android 7.0 or newer

### Fix microG installation on GApps-infected Stock ROMs

`-m`, `--fix-microg`
