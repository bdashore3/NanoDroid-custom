NanoDroid-wise the transistion is done in-place, but you will have to re-setup the application.

  * old: nanodroid_nlpbackend=[0|1|2|3] (default: nanodroid_nlpbackend=1)
  * new: nanodroid_nlpbackend=[0|1][0|1][0|1] (default: nanodroid_nlpbackend=100)
    * 1st element = whether to install Déjà Vu location backend
    * 2nd element = whether to install Ichnaea (Mozilla) location backend

## 20.0.20181111 "Nimitz"

### Important Notes

```
NanoDroid can no longer be flashed through Magisk Manager!

While flashing through Magisk Manager worked for most users
in most cases, it did not always, if it failed it caused
major headache, thus the change.

The following packages now require flashing through TWRP:
- NanoDroid (Full)
- NanoDroid-microG
- NanoDroid-FDroid
- NanoDroid-BromiteWebView

The following packages always required flashing through TRWP:
- NanoDroid-Uninstaller
- NanoDroid-SetupWizard

The following package can still be flashed trough Magisk Manager:
- NanoDroid-Patcher

Of course installation as Magisk Module is not effected.

## 7.0.20140725
* Internal Changes
  * some ROMs don't have a `zip` binary which is required for the on-device `framework-patcher` to work
     * it now provides arm and arm64 `zip` binaries as fallback
  * all packages: let the installers fails if device has x86/x86_64 architecture (NanoMod only supports arm/arm64)
  * full and microG-only packages: if the installers create default configuration files because no user-defined exist, those files get removed after installation
     * this is to ensure the users who don't care about them always get the default configuration
     * obvioulsy, if you opt-in to create your own setup, it won't be affected by this
  * full and microG-only package: if the setup file is incomplete, add the missing properties with default values
  * microG-only package: set default value of `nanomod.overlay` to `0`
  * microG-only package: create the application overrides if `nanomod.overlay` is `1`
