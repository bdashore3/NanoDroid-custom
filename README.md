# Nanodroid Custom

NanoDroid is a installer for various OpenSource related things, most noticably microG and F-Droid. It supports direct /system installation, both devices with or without A/B partition scheme, aswell as Magisk Mode (module) installation. It also includes several tools (eg. GNU Bash, GNU Nano, more), scripts, fonts, sounds and additional features (system debloating, init scripts, automatic logcat creation), aswell as a companion F-Droid Repository.

Furthermore it allows the user to do fine-graded installations using configuration files, which allow to choose what to install, or if several alternatives are available, which of them, see [Alter Installation](#alter-installation) below. 

NanoDroid allows you to choose between the official microG GmsCore and a custom microG GmsCore (default), [list of changes](https://github.com/Nanolx/android_packages_apps_GmsCore#changes).

In order for full microG experience NanoDroid contains a modified Play Store which allows (in-)app-purchases with microG, which would normally not be possible. It also tries to remove all previously installed GApps on it's own. For ROMs without builtin signature spoofing support NanoDroid includes an on-device Patcher which tries to patch your ROM from TWRP.

Versions until 15.1 were called **NanoMod**, starting with 16.0 they're called **NanoDroid**.

* Beta Downloads [> Nanolx](https://downloads.nanolx.org/NanoDroid/Beta)

### SHA256 Checksum and GPG Signature

Since version 18.3.1 all releases hosted on nanolx.org contain a SHA256 checksum and GPG signature to check their validity. AFH does provide the SHA256 checksum on the downloads summary page, but does not allow to upload a GPG signature.

You can obtain the public part of my GPG key from:

* download the public key from [photonic.asc](https://downloads.nanolx.org/NanoDroid/Stable/photonic.asc)
  * import it using `gpg --import photonic.asc`
* download and import using `gpg` from pgp.mit.edu:
  * `gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv B0ABCE622A077B584B81339E340FD70EFFC52B26`

You can verify the checksum and signature like:

```
gpg --verify NanoDroid-19.0.20181027.zip.sha256.sig
sha256sum -c NanoDroid-19.0.20181027.zip.sha256
```

Additionally you may want to ensure the signing date is close to the release date.

### Snapshots

You can create snapshots from this repository.

* on GNU/Linux, MacOS or *BSD clone this repository and use the provided `build-package` script like
  * download required files:
     * `build-package pull` to download all required apks and libraries for the Full, microG and F-Droid packages
  * build packages:
     * `build-package full` to create the Full package
     * `build-package microg` to create the microG only package
     * `build-package fdroid` to create the F-Droid only package
     * `build-package patcher` to create the on-device framework-patcher package
     * `build-package uninstaller` to create the uninstaller package
     * `build-package setupwizard` to create the Setup Wizard package
     * `build-package bromitewebview` to create the Bromite WebView package
     * `build-package osmand` for the OpenStreetMap (OsmAnd) package
     * `build-package systest` to create the SysTest package
     * `build-package all` to create all packages at once
  * update required files:
     * `build-package u-microg` to update microG
     * `build-package u-fdroid` to update F-Droid
     * `build-package u-apps` to update (most) applications
     * `build-package u-swipe` to update swipe libraries
     * `build-package u-gsync` to update Google Sync Adapters
     * `build-package u-bromite` to update Bromite WebView
     * `build-package u-osmand` to update OpenStreetMap (OsmAnd)
     * `build-package pull` to update/re-download everything

for apks downloaded from F-Droid repositories or from APK Mirror, `build-package` checks the SHA256 hash.

The `build-package` script additionally supports the following parameters:

* `check` check if all files were properly downloaded
* `clean` remove any untracked files from the repo (e. g. from `build-package pull`)
* `dalvik [.jar]` prepare a jar file for use with DalvikVM (requires Android SDK)
* `ver [version] [date]` change project version
* `bump` increment Magisk module version by 1

The following applications are custom builds (see [F-Droid Repository](#f-droid-repository) below):

* Play Store (reason: re-signed and modified to support (in-)app-purchases with microG GmsCore)
  * [microG (in-)app-purchase support patch](doc/Phonesky.diff)
* microG GmsCore (reason: built with additions)
  * [source (with detailed changes)](https://github.com/Nanolx/android_packages_apps_GmsCore)
* microG DroidGuard Helper (reason: built with fix for non 32bit arm devices failing SafetyNet attestation)
  * [source](https://github.com/ThibG/android_packages_apps_RemoteDroidGuard/tree/aarch64)
* OmniJAWS (reason: no binary built outside of OmniROM available)
  * [source](https://github.com/omnirom/android_packages_services_OmniJaws)
* MPV (reason: infrequent updates)
  * [source](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android)
  * [version code patch](https://nanolx.org/fdroid/mpv.diff)
* OpenLauncher (reason: infrequent updates)
  * [source](https://github.com/OpenLauncherTeam/openlauncher)
  * [version code patch](https://nanolx.org/fdroid/openlauncher.diff)

Also `build-package` looks if the configuration files

* `.nanodroid-setup`
* `.nanodroid-apps`
* `.nanodroid-overlay`

exist in the `data` directory of the repository, if so, those files are used when creating packages instead of the default ones from the `doc` directory.

See the documentation below for more information on those files and what they do.

Full [> Details](doc/ZeldaSounds.md)

### Nintendo Fonts

NanoDroid includes Nintendo Fonts.

Full [> Details](doc/NanoDroidFont.md)

## Installation

### Alter Installation

NanoDroid supports altering the installation settings to a wide degree.

Full [> Details](doc/AlterInstallation.md) on altering installation manually, or use the Setup Wizard (if you've got an arm/arm64 device).

### Installation Process

#### NanoDroid

* Use Setup Wizard to create configuration files (if you've got an arm/arm64 device), or create manually (see above)
* Download pre-built zip or create one from this repository

##### Installing from scratch

This is the recommended way.

### Stock ROM without GApps, custom ROM with/without OpenGApps

OpenGApps and GApps-less ROMs don't need further measurements, the Installer takes care of required steps.

* perform full wipe (/system, /data, /cache, Dalvik/ART cache)
  * recommended, but not required
* install desired ROM
  * make sure it does **not** include GApps if you want to use microG
     * NanoDroid tries to get rid of GApps on it's own, but it may not always work, try without any warranty
* install **Magisk**
  * recommended, but not required
  * if **Magisk** is installed, NanoDroid will be installed as Magisk-Module, else it will install into `/system` directly
* install desired Kernel (if any)
* install **NanoDroid**
  * if you want to use microG make sure the ROM is either pre-patched with signature spoofing support or **deoxeded** so you can patch yourself [see here](doc/DeodexServices.md)
     * you can use the Patcher package to de-odex (up to Android 8.1) and/or patch services.jar (up to Android 9.0)
* reboot into ROM

### Stock ROM with GApps

Stock ROMs with GApps may not allow to switch from Google GmsCore to microG GmsCore in-place, thus the installation is slightly different.

* perform full wipe (/system, /data, /cache, Dalvik/ART cache)
  * recommended, but not required
* install desired ROM
  * make sure it does **not** include GApps if you want to use microG
     * NanoDroid tries to get rid of GApps on it's own, but it may not always work, try without any warranty
* install **Magisk**
  * recommended, but not required
  * if **Magisk** is installed, NanoDroid will be installed as Magisk-Module, else it will install into `/system` directly
  * if you want to use microG make sure the ROM is either pre-patched with signature spoofing support or **deoxeded** so you can patch yourself [see here](doc/DeodexServices.md)
     * you can use the Patcher package to de-odex (up to Android 8.1) and/or patch services.jar (up to Android 9.0)
* install desired Kernel (if any)
* mount `/system` read-write and remove the following folders
  * `/system/priv-app/GmsCore`
  * `/system/priv-app/GsfProxy`
  * `/system/priv-app/Phonesky`
* boot into ROM (ignore all those complaints that Play Services are missing)
  * this is step is required!
* reboot to TWRP
* install **NanoDroid**
  * if you want to use microG make sure the ROM is either pre-patched with signature spoofing support or **deoxeded** so you can patch yourself [see here](doc/DeodexServices.md)
     * you can use the Patcher package to de-odex (up to Android 8.1) and/or patch services.jar (up to Android 9.0)
* reboot into ROM

##### Upgrade / Installing on a clean ROM

When upgrading NanoDroid or installing on a known clean ROM (read: GApps free), you may also just

* install **Magisk**
  * recommended, but not required
  * if **Magisk** is installed, NanoDroid will be installed as Magisk-Module, else it will install into `/system` directly
* install **NanoDroid**
* reboot

#### microG

##### Signature Spoofing Support

For **microG** to work, your ROM needs to have signature spoofing enabled (or a **deodexed** ROM to patch yourself).

If your ROM does **not** have signature spoofing support, you can manually patch it either
  * flashing the on-device Patcher zip
     * it also installs an addon.d script that auto re-patches the ROM upon update

If your ROM is **odexed** read [this instructions](doc/DeodexServices.md) on how to deodex services.jar manually

The Patcher supports installing the patched `services.jar` into the following locations:
  * NanoDroid Magisk Module
  * NanoDroid-microG Magisk Module
  * directly into `/system`

So you can use it regardless whether you're using NanoDroid or not.

##### microG Setup

Once your ROM supports signature spoofing, you need to setup microG like this
  * go into **microG settings** and set up everything like:
     * check results in **Self-Check**, grant missing permissions (by tapping on them)
         * especially the **Battery Optimization** item
         * if Phonesky (= Fake Store or Play Store) lacks signature spoofing permissions head to Settings / Apps / Permissions / Signature Spoofing and grant it
     * enable **Google device registration**
     * enable **Google Cloud Messaging** (only if you want to receive push messages from your applications)
     * enable **Google SafetyNet** (required for applications that utilize SafetyNet, for example Pokémon GO, ...)
     * in **UnifiedNlp Settings** choose either any or all of
         * **Déjà Vu**, **Mozilla**, **Apple** as Geolocation backend
         * **Nominatim** as Address lockup backend
     * after everything is done, reboot
     * if you installed **Play Store** open it, setup account and install your apps

## Issues

List of known issues and their respective fixes or workarounds.

### microG

* Battery Drain
  * microG fails to register applications to GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) if they were installed **before** microG, but the apps keep trying to register and that causes the battery drain, all apps installed **after** microG are properly registered, to fix the battery drain either
     * do a clean flash of your ROM (, Magisk) and NanoDroid and install your apps after microG setup
     * uninstall and re-install all your applications (backup application data if required)
* microG lacks features
  * if you use AppOps, PrivacyGuard or the like you have to grant microG GmsCore **all** permissions, if you prevent some permissions, some apps or features might not work as expected or not at all. Note: some APIs/features are stubs in microG GmsCore, meaning they exist that apps don't complain, but they do nothing - thus blocking microG GmsCore is pretty much of no benefit.
* You can't get past the first page of the microG login wizard on KitKat
  * either connect a Keyboard and use it to skip the first page (will work normally then)
  * use the custom NanoDroid microG GmsCore build, which has this issue fixed starting with version 0.2.6.14799-dirty-145

### SafetyNet

* Applications/SafetyNet check complain with `Google Play Services are missing`
  * you did not
      * [setup microG](#microg-setup) (or did not reboot afterwards)
      * grant signature spoofing permission to Fake Store or Play Store
         * go to Settings / Apps / Permissions / Signature Spoofing and grant it
      * install either Fake Store or Play Store
* SafetyNet check fails after upgrading Magisk to version 18.0
  * go to Magisk Manager > Magisk Hide and activate it for `microG DroidGuard Helper`
* Applications crash during SafetyNet check
  * install microG DroidGuard Helper as user-app (required on some ROMs), as root, on-device, issue:
      * `pm install -r /system/app/DroidGuard/DroidGuard.apk`
      * this is done automatically in Magisk Mode (as of version 20.5)

### Play Store

* Play Store giving error RH-01
  * ensure you rebooted after [microG setup](#microg-setup)
  * ensure Play Store has signature spoofing permission
      * go to Settings / Apps / Permissions / Signature Spoofing and grant it
  * force close Play Store and open it again

### Push Messages

* Apps are not receiving Push messages
  * go to microG Settings / Google Cloud Messaging and check if it is connected
  * ensure you don't have an adblocker blocking the domain `mtalk.google.com` it is required for GCM to work
  * when using Titanium Backup first install the app only (without data) and start it, this will register the app, after that you can restore the data using Titanium Backup
  * if an app is not shown as registered in microG Settings / Google Cloud Messaging, try uninstalling and re-installing it
  * when restoring the ROM from a TWRP backup GCM is often broken, no workaround currently known, except uninstalling and re-installing the apps

### Unified Nlp

* unified Nlp is not registered in the system
  * some ROMs with native signature spoofing don't look for `com.google.android.gms` as location provider
  * tell the developer (or maintainer) of the ROM to fix this
* unified Nlp is registered in the system, but fails to get location
  * issue the following commands as root, on-device:
     * `pm grant com.google.android.gms android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
     * `pm grant com.google.android.gms android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`

### F-Droid

* On some ROMs (most noticeably MIUI ROMs) F-Droid can't install applications
  * this is because F-Droid's Priviledged Extension is not compatible with those ROMs, disable it from
      * F-Droid > Settings > Expert Settings > Privileged Extension

### Other

* Some Stock ROMs do not properly work after first boot since their SetupWizard is disabled by NanoDroid (because it's incompatible with microG)
  * check `/system/build.prop` or `/vendor/build.prop` if they contain the property `ro.setupwizard.mode` and change it to (you can do this from TWRP via ADB, with the builtin `vi` editor)
      * `ro.setupwizard.mode=DISABLED`
      * in Magisk Mode NanoDroid will do this on it's own using Magisk's `resetprop`
  * if you can access your device via ADB, you can also issue the following command as root, on-device:
      * `nanodroid-util --fix-update`
* Applications crash when using WebView (BromiteWebView package)
  * install Bromite WebView as user-app, as root, on-device, issue:
      * `pm install -r /system/app/BromiteWebView/BromiteWebView.apk`
      * this is done automatically in Magisk Mode (as of version 20.5)
* ROM lags after applying signature spoofing patch
  * some ROMs already have the patch built-in, if you patch those ROMs (again), it results in heavy lags

### Google Software

* Hangouts isn't properly working
  * as root, on-device, run the following command:
     * `pm disable com.google.android.talk/com.google.android.apps.hangouts.service.NetworkConnectionCheckingService`
